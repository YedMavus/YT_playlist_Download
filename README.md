# Youtube Playlist Downloader

I happen to have a terrible attention span and self control, and often end up surfing youtube when I tune in to watch a series of lectures. My solution? Turn off the internet and watch the lecture. 

But since all lectures are on youtube, it is not possible to do this. 

This code is an answer to that challenge: now you can use it too.
Download youtube videos within the playlist by running this script to specified folder.
The folder can be specified by modifying the code.
To run, type
python <filename>

This asks for the playlist link, which needs to be pasted into the terminal, and the download starts automatically.
